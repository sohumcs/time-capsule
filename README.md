# Digital Time Capsule Using React

The digital time capsule I created using React is an interactive web application that allows users to store memories, files, and messages securely for future retrieval. This time capsule simulates the concept of a traditional time capsule but in a digital format, offering a futuristic approach to preserving memories.

## Key Features:

### 1. User-Friendly Form
The app features an intuitive form that enables users to create a time capsule. Users can enter a message, attach files, and set a specific unlock date, defining when the capsule will become accessible. This makes it a simple yet powerful tool for preserving meaningful content for the future.

### 2. Unlock Date and Countdown
One of the unique features is the ability to set an unlock date for the time capsule. Once the date is set, the app displays a countdown timer showing how much time remains until the capsule can be opened. This countdown builds anticipation and excitement for users awaiting the release of their memories.

### 3. File Upload
Users can upload files (such as images, videos, or documents) to be stored within the time capsule. These files will be securely kept and unlocked only when the set date arrives.

### 4. Capsule List
The app displays all created time capsules in an organized grid-like structure, showing upcoming capsules with their unlock dates. Users can easily track what capsules they've created and when they will become available.

### 5. Futuristic Design
The design of the app features a sleek, futuristic theme with a glowing neon color palette. The interface is clean and modern, with smooth animations and a space-like gradient background that enhances the digital experience.

### 6. Social Integration
Iâ€™ve also added GitHub and LinkedIn icons that link directly to my profiles, making it easy for users to find me online and view more about my work.

## Technology Stack:
- **React** for building the interactive UI and managing state.
- **CSS** for styling, with a focus on a futuristic, glowing theme.
- **HTML5** for structuring the content and forms.

## Future Scope:
The digital time capsule could be further enhanced by adding user authentication, encrypting stored files for privacy, and enabling notifications when the capsule is about to unlock. The possibilities for improvement are vast, making it an exciting project for ongoing development.
